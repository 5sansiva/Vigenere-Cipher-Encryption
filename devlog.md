I set up the project including taking the python files from the given zip file. This project involves me building a system using three seperate files.
Those include a logger, an encryption program, and a driver program.
I will be doing this project in python, so I will utilize the subprocess module that is available. I will start my session on working the project.

Session ended at 6:30, 3/1/2025
So I mainly spent time really understanding the flow of the project and getting a feel of how I should structure the files and such. I accomplished my goal, so for the next session, I will focus on how the encryption and decryption process works.

1:37 PM, 3/6/2025
I am looking through the files right now. I have understood how to encrypt and decrypt the program and I will setup those functions.

During this work session, I made sure to setup the encrypt and decrypt programs and the formula for those programs. I also spent more time really understanding the flow between how the files should interact with each other along with how the user should interact with the program. Next session, I will focus more on the logger file and then start working on the driver file.

7:51 PM, 3/9/2025
So far, I understand how the project is supposed to run. Main file which makes subprocesses where one is the logger file and the other is with the encryption file. I haven't had any new thoughts since the last session. I plan to further finish the logger and then work on the driver file. My goal is to finish the logger, and then maybe start with the driver.

8:30 PM 3/9/2025
So from this work session, I finished setting up the logger file and then began working on the driver. I didn't encounter any problems so far this session as it was mainly just following the pdf instructions that were given about this project. Next session, I hope to finish the driver file and then setup everything and test.

1:40 PM, 3/11/2025
I got a better understanding of the flow between the driver file to the encryption and logger. I need to rechange the scheme in driver and encryption to better send instructions from driver to those subprocesses. My goal is to setup the connection between the logger and the driver properly this work session.

I wasn't able to get much done this work session, mainly because my environment was rather loud and I had a lot of distractions, so I decided to get work done later, which is why this session wasn't very productive. My next session, I plan to finish the goals I had previously set in my last session.

3:09 pm 3/18/2025
Current thoughts - Nothing new so far, I have not touched the project in some days but I have a clearer idea on what I have to do, and the flow of my project from the driver file to the other two files that are present.
Current session goals - This session, I plan to fix the flow between the files, something that I wasn't able to finish during my last sesssion, so I want to make sure the driver calls the encryption and the logger with proper subprocesses and set those up properly.

8:03 pm 3/18/2025
Session Reflection: So I managed to finish the driver file, and also adjust the connection between the driver and the encryption file and the logger file. I still need to tweak the logger file so that every action is logged better. I didn't encounter any new problems so that was good. I accomplished my goal for this session, so for next session, I want to make sure every connection and logic is sound, then test the code more and make sure it is working properly.

3:56 pm 3/19/2025
Current thoughts - Haven't had any new thoughts.
Current session goals - I plan to do testing to see if my program works the way it is intented to. I originally did testing only for the encryption file to make sure the encrypt and decrypt methods were working properly and they were. I plan to really go through the project and ensure various test cases are working and that the project meets the instructions.

6:30 3/19/2025
Session reflection - I encounted some new problems, mainly the flow between the menus, or going from the seperate history menu back to the main menu, or the encrypted value and decrypted value not being stored in the result properly. I did accomplish part of my goal which was to do testing and see if my project runs so far and if there were any errors. Initially there were some minor error due to me calling the subprocess module directly along with certain type mismatches during input and such, but I managed to address those issues.
Next session - I plan to further test out all the commands and essentially try as many combinations of passwords, encryptions, and decryptions along with further fixing the format the logger.py logs in.
