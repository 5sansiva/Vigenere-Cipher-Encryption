I set up the project including taking the python files from the given zip file. This project involves me building a system using three seperate files.
Those include a logger, an encryption program, and a driver program.
I will be doing this project in python, so I will utilize the subprocess module that is available. I will start my session on working the project.

I am looking through the files right now. I have understood how to encrypt and decrypt the program and I will setup those functions.
